This was my master's thesis on conic portfolio theory. 
My project was a deep analysis into the regulatory fitness of conic financial theory with respect to portfolio selection.

The code in this repository was built to calculate four different portfolios:
1. Markowitz minimum variance portfolio
2. Value-at-Risk (VaR) portfolio
3. Tail VaR (also named conditional VaR) portfolio
4. Conic portfolio

The code for 1 and 3 are not based on prior distributional assumptions. We can calculate those directly on the return data of a portfolio.
The code for 2 uses a heuristic outlined in [1]. 
The code for 4 is based on the algorithm outlined in [2].
